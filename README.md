# Halloween Candy Machine
This is the code for my candy machine project. This is a non-working public version. All of the assets (images, audio, etc) have been removed as some of them are non-free.

The purpose of this codebase is to share what I built with others in the hopes that someone will be inspired by it. The application cannot be run as is, but I hope that someone can make use of some of the code.
